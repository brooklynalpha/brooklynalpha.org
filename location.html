						When we were choosing a location to host Brooklyn Alpha, we decided early on that we wanted to have it at a venue that had that distinct “Brooklyn” feel to it. The Cabinet is about has Brooklyn as Biggie. The building was home to the American Packing Box factory from 1915-1954. Nowadays, its neighborhood – Gowanas – is quickly becoming home to a slew of art spaces, something else and a handful of other creative ventures by motivated Brooklynites. <b>You're gonna love it!</b>
