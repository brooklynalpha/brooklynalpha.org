# Brooklyn Alpha
Brooklyn Alpha is a small, friendly web build-a-thon and conference. Over three days in beautiful Brooklyn, NY, you will have the chance to meet, greet, and work together with other driven designers and developers to take an idea and turn it into a reality.

## Working on this little site
We're using Compass, so before making any style changes you'll want to navigate to the
root directory in your sweet-ass Terminal and run `compass watch`.
