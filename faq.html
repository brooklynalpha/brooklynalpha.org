                <dt>Do I need to have a team or have a project started already?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Nope. The first thing we'll do is have a big brainstorming session where everyone can throw
                    out ideas and let everyone know what type of skills they'll need to build their idea. Each team
                    will form based on who wants to work on what.
                </dd>
                <dt>I already have a project started, is it OK if I bring that and get help from others?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Absolutely! There's a good chance that another Alphateer will be looking for a project to get involved with.
                </dd>
                <dt>Is this a competition?</dt>
                <dd>
                    No. What we want to do is fill a room full of you passionate people, have you share big ideas
                    and focus on building something. Every team and indiviual is encouraged to give and receive
                    feedback to every other team and indiviual on ideas, designs, and code.
                </dd>
                <dt>Does Brooklyn Alpha retain any ownership or rights to my project?</dt>
                <dd>
                    None at all. Your projects are your projects.
                </dd>
                <dt>I'm still on fence about whether I should come to Alpha or not.</dt>
                <dd>
                    That's not a question, but we're flexible so we'll give you an answer anyhow. Yes, you should join us!
                </dd>
                <dt>Will there be delicious lunch catered each day from a different local vendor?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Oh, indeed. You like BBQ? How about Middle Eastern cuisine? Of course you do.
                    <br>We'll also keep the place stocked with plenty of
                    healthy snacks along with coffee, tea, Red Bull, Jolt Cola, etc. to keep everyone fueled.
                </dd>
                <dt>Hey, isn't there another event going on at the same with a similar name?</dt>
                <dd>
                    There is, <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org">Brooklyn Beta</a>. We're in cahoots with them and
                    we're a part of <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/beyond">Beyond Beta</a>. You have zero
                    excuse for not being in Brooklyn the second week of October with all this rad stuff going on!
                </dd>
                <dt>Is there a chance I will become so overly excited by the level of motivation and talent in the room that I pass out?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes, we'll be covering the floor with mattresses to project your noggins.
