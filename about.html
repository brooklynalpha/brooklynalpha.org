				<h1>Why Brooklyn Alpha?</h1>
				<p>
					In October of 2010, <a href="http://analog.coop/">Analog</a> and <a href="http://fictivekin.com/">Fictive Kin</a> put on a friendly web conference in Brooklyn.
					It was a small affair, compared to some of the more well established web conferences of the time, but it quickly became known to be one of the most incredible gatherings of web professionals around.
					It wasn’t just the amazing speakers, but the attendees, that proved to be what made <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/2010/">Brooklyn Beta</a> such a great event.
					By the end of the day, people were already excited for 2011, and anyone that missed out wanted to be a part of it.
				</p>

				<p>
					When tickets went on sale for <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/2011/">Brooklyn Beta 2011</a>, they sold out.
					Quickly.
					In an amount of time measured in seconds, not minutes.
					Even with a greater number of tickets available, a balance had to be found between including people, and keeping the friendliness of 2010.
					That meant that a number of people, including previous attendees, would be unable to attend.
					But while the content of the conference itself was phenomenal, a huge part of the magic was what happened in between the content.
					Recognizing this, and somewhat in jest, the idea of <a href="http://brewklynbeta/2011">Brewklyn Beta</a> was formed.
					For those of us that wouldn’t be involved in Brooklyn Beta, it would still be great to be able to get together and talk shop with each other, and with everyone else gathered in Brooklyn for the conference.
				</p>

				<p>
					The idea for an unconference during Brooklyn Beta evolved as we tried to figure out what we wanted to do, and what we could do in the limited time that we had available.
					Getting together in a social setting was a good start, but we wanted to do more.
					One of the goals of Brooklyn Beta has always been to motivate people to bring their ideas to life, and to get people together in a way that can make that happen.
					And what better place to get together than in Brooklyn, the best borough in the world?
				</p>

				<p>
					The scope of Brewklyn Beta expanded beyond just “get together and do some stuff in Brooklyn anyway” and we realized where we would fit in the environment created by Brooklyn Beta.
					While Brooklyn Beta is a beta offering to inspire web professionals to build something, <strong>Brooklyn Alpha</strong> is the alpha offering.
					A bit more experimental, a bit rougher around the edges, but still focussed on getting things done.
					We aim to not only inspire you, but get you over that initial hurdle of having something to show for your efforts.
					All too often, ideas languish because of fear that they’re unfinished and not ready to be shown off.
					Our goal is to dispel those fears and bring those ideas to life.
