					<h1>Why Brooklyn Alpha?</h1>
					<p>
						In October of 2010, <a href="http://analog.coop/">Analog</a> and <a href="http://fictivekin.com/">Fictive Kin</a> put on a friendly web conference in Brooklyn.
						It was a small affair, but it quickly became known to be <mark>one of the most incredible gatherings of web professionals</mark> around.
						It wasn’t just the amazing speakers, but the attendees, that proved to be what made <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/2010/">Brooklyn Beta</a> such a great event.
					</p>
                	
					<p>
						When tickets went on sale for <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/2011/">Brooklyn Beta 2011</a>, they sold out.
						Quickly.
						In an amount of time measured in <mark>seconds, not minutes</mark>.
						Even with a greater number of tickets available, a balance had to be found between including people, and keeping the friendliness of 2010.
						That meant that a number of people would be unable to attend.
						But while the content of the conference itself was phenomenal, a huge part of the magic was what happened in between the content.

				<h1>The Spin-Off</h1>
				<p>
					The idea for an unconference during Brooklyn Beta evolved as we tried to figure out what we wanted it to be, and what we could do in the limited time that we had available.
					One of the goals of Brooklyn Beta is to <mark>motivate people</mark> to bring their ideas to life, and to get people together in a way that can <mark>make that happen</mark>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The scope of Brewklyn Beta expanded beyond just "get together and do some stuff in Brooklyn anyway" and we realized where we would fit in the environment created by Brooklyn Beta.
					While Brooklyn Beta is a beta offering to inspire web professionals to build something, <mark><strong>Brooklyn Alpha</strong></mark> is the alpha offering.
					A bit more experimental, a bit rougher around the edges, but focussed on getting things done.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We aim to not only <mark>inspire you</mark>, but get you over that initial hurdle of having something to show for your efforts.
					All too often, ideas languish because of fear that they’re unfinished and not ready to be shown off.
					Our goal is to dispel those fears and <mark>bring those ideas to life</mark>.
