					<h1>Why Brooklyn Alpha?</h1>
					<p>
						In October of 2010, <a href="http://analog.coop/">Analog</a> and <a href="http://fictivekin.com/">Fictive Kin</a> put on a friendly web conference in Brooklyn.
						It was a small affair, but it quickly became known as <mark>one of the most incredible gatherings of web professionals</mark> around.
						It wasn’t just the amazing speakers, but the attendees, that proved to be what made <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/2010/">Brooklyn Beta</a> such a great event.
					</p>
                	
					<p>
						When tickets went on sale for <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/2011/">Brooklyn Beta 2011</a>, they <mark>sold out in seconds</mark>.
						Even with a greater number of tickets available, a balance had to be found between demand and keeping the friendliness of 2010.
						But while the content of the conference itself was phenomenal, a huge part of the magic was what happened in between the presentations.
						We had to find a way to keep that going.

					<h1>The Spin-Off</h1>
					<p>
						The idea for an un-conference during Brooklyn Beta evolved as we tried to figure out what we wanted it to be, and what we could do in the limited time that we had available.
						One of the goals of Brooklyn Beta is to <mark>motivate people</mark> to bring their ideas to life, and to get people together in a way that can <mark>make that happen</mark>.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						The scope expanded beyond just "get together and do some stuff in Brooklyn anyway" and we realized where we would fit in the environment created by Brooklyn Beta.
						While Brooklyn Beta is a beta offering to inspire web professionals to build something, <mark><strong>Brooklyn Alpha</strong></mark> is the alpha offering.
						A bit more experimental, a bit rough around the edges, but focused on getting things done.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						We aim to not only <mark>inspire you</mark>, but get you over that initial hurdle of having something to show for your efforts.
						All too often, ideas languish because of fear that they’re unfinished and not ready to be shown off.
						Our goal is to dispel those fears and <mark>bring those ideas to life</mark>.
