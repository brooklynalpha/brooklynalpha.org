	<h2><a href="">Two Guys from BKLYN</a> present: Another friendly web conference and hack-a-thon</h2>
	<h1>Brooklyn Alpha</h1>
	<p>
		Join us for three days in October where we'll get down to business and make something great.
		This friendly gathering will be one part a time to get inspired by a select few speakers who have
		been around the block a time or two and one part getting together with other bright-eyed motivated
		designers and developers who want to get down to the business of building things.
	</p>
	<p>
		Interested? We'd love to have you.
