                <h1>Why Brooklyn Alpha?</h1>
                <p>
                    Many conferences aim to educate and inspire their attendees.
                    While this works well for many folks, we want to take it a step farther.
                    We want to get all of those educated and inspired people together to build great things.
                    By putting a bunch of super cool designers and developers in one place and helping them work together
                    toward a common goal we know that amazing things will come out of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the course of three full days, you will be dreaming, designing, building, and presenting your project.
                    Every person that attends will be a key player in bringing a project to life.
                    You may not know your co-conspirators at the beginning, but by the end, they will be your partners.
                </p>

                <h1>Game Plan</h1>
                <p>
                    We'll be kicking things off on day one with a brainstorming/pitch session where you can bring your ideas
                    to the table and see what resonates with your fellow craftspeople.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're not looking for the next billion dollar company (please, no "make a picture taken with a several
                    hundred dollar piece of technology look like it was taken with a shaky camera made out of Legos" apps),
                    but what we are looking for is something that will be engaging, interesting and fun.
                    Also, it must be presentable within three days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of our build time, every team will be presenting their project to the rest of the group to show
                    off what you've accomplished, talk about what went well and what didn't and discuss where you're seeing
                    the project move forward.
                </p>

                <ul class="faq">
                    <li>
                        <b>Q: Do I need to have a team or a project started already?</b>
                        A: No, not at all. The first thing we'll do is have a big brainstorming session where everyone can throw
                        out ideas and let everyone know what type of skills they'll need to build their idea. When you hear
                        an idea that you like, let them know you're down to work on it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Q: I already have a project started, is it OK if I bring that and get help from others?</b>
                        A: Absolutely!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Q: Will there be delicious lunch catered each day from a different local vendor?</b>
                        A: Oh, indeed. We'll also keep the place stocked with plenty of healthy snacks, coffee, tea, Jolt Cola, etc.
                        to keep everyone fueled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Q: Hey, isn't there another event going on at the same with a similar name?</b>
                        A: There is, <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org">Brooklyn Beta</a>. We're in cahoots with them and
                        we're a part of <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/beyond">Beyond Beta</a>.

                    <li>
                        <b>Q: Is there a chance I will become so overly excited by the level of motivation and talent in the room that I pass out?</b>
                        A: Yes, we'll be covering the floor with mattresses to project your noggins.
