                <p>
                    Many conferences aim to educate and inspire their attendees. While this is all well and good for the
                    normies, we aim a little higher.
                    We want to get all of your cool people together to build great things.
                    By putting a bunch of super cool designers and developers in one place and helping them work together
                    toward a common goal we know that amazing things will come of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the course of three full days, you will be dreaming, designing, building, and presenting your project.
                    Every person that attends will be a key player in bringing a project to life.
                    You may not know your co-conspirators at the beginning, but by the end, they will be your partners.
                </p>

                <h1>Order of Operations</h1>
                <p>
                    We'll be kicking things off on day one with a brainstorming/pitch session where you can bring your ideas
                    to the table and see what resonates with your fellow craftspeople.
                    We're not looking for the next billion dollar company (please, no "make a picture taken with a several
                    hundred dollar piece of technology look like it was taken with a shaky camera made out of Legos" apps),
                    but what we are looking for is something that will be engaging, interesting and fun.
                    Also, it must be presentable within three days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of our build time, every team will be presenting their project to the other Alphateers to show
                    off what you've accomplished, talk about what went well and what didn't and discuss where you're seeing
                    the project move forward.
