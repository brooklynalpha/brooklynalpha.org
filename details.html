				<h1>What exactly is Brooklyn Alpha?</h1>
				<p>
					At Brooklyn Alpha we will start out by hearing from a select number of speakers who have been down the road of nurturing an idea into something real. Their stories of trying and failing and succeeding should light a fire in you and get you excited about working toward a similar goal creating something that you love.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>
					After listening to the stories of others it's your turn. At this point all attendees will form small teams of approx. 3-5 talented individuals. Each team will then begin the process of dreaming up an idea, developing that idea through hearty discussion and ultimately begin working on designing and building that idea into a functional product.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>
					On the final day you and your team will get to present your finished product and the process you went through to get there to us and the other teams. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the end, this is a friendly competition. Each teams' project will be voted on and a winner chosen by our panel of friendly judges.
