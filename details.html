				<h1>What exactly is Brooklyn Alpha?</h1>
				<p>
					Brooklyn Alpha is a 3 day web build-a-thon and conference taking place in the heart of Brooklyn. Our goal is to light a fire in you and get you excited about <mark>creating something</mark> you love. Then actually creating it. You will be hearing from a select number of speakers who have been <mark>down the road</mark> of nurturing an idea into something real. Their stories of trying, failing and ultimately succeeding will drive you to action. We promise.
				</p>
				<aside>
					If you join us at Brooklyn Alpha&hellip; you will design and build a project in less than 3 days.

			</section>
			<section class="alt">
				<p>
					After listening to the stories of others, it's your turn. You'll be able to recruit your fellow attendees to help <mark>make your project come to life</mark>. Or be recruited, and join in making something great. Each team will be brainstorming, planning, designing and implementing a project in what amounts to a typical weekend. You always said you could have made Twitter in a weekend.
				</p>
				<aside>
					If you join us at Brooklyn Alpha&hellip; you will befriend at least 1 amazingly talented designer or developer. Maybe 3.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>
					On the final day, you and your team will present your finished product and the <mark>process you went through</mark> to get there. While this is a friendly competition, the only real competition that you have is the deadline and your own standard of excellence. There are no grand prizes for winners, though we might have something in store for a particularly impressive team.
				</p>
				<aside>
					If you join us at Brooklyn Alpha&hellip; and your team's project wins, you will receive hearty congrats and back pats.
