				<h1>What exactly is Brooklyn Alpha?</h1>
				<div>
					<p>
						Brooklyn Alpha is a three day web build-a-thon and conference where a small group of <mark>friendly</mark>, <mark>motivated</mark> web designers and developers will work together to develop ideas, make new friends and ultimately <mark>create something</mark>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our first task is to help <mark>light a fire</mark> in you by having a select number of speakers on the topic of working on projects that they love. They'll share with you their stories of getting that spark of an idea and the process they took to turn that idea into something real.
					</p>
				</div>
				<aside>
					If you join us at Brooklyn Alpha&hellip; you will work with a team to design and build a project in less than 3 days.

					<p>
						After hearing the stories of others, it's your turn. At this point you'll be able to recruit your fellow attendees, or be recruited, to work on a team to <mark>make your projects come to life</mark>. We'll also have the full list of attendees on our site before we meet, so if you already have an idea and want to start chatting with other folks and forming teams ahead of time, we encourage you to do so.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the next day and a half, each team will be brainstorming, planning, designing and implementing a project in what amounts to a typical weekend. During the working time, we'll encourage everyone to share their ideas, share their designs, share their code and get feedback from as many others as possible. While this is a friendly competition, everyone should feel comfortable getting feedback from any other team at any time, <mark>we're all friends here</mark>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<aside>
					If you join us at Brooklyn Alpha&hellip; you will befriend at least 1 amazingly talented designer or developer. Maybe 64.

					<p>
						On the last day, you and your team will get the chance to present your finished product and the <mark>process you went through</mark> to get there. While we're excited for all aspects of Brooklyn Alpha, we're especially excited for this part. Getting to hear from you folks about what went well, what worked and what didn't will be a huge value to everyone in the room. We also fully expect some, if not all, of your projects to keep evolving. You should think of this as the kick-off for your project, not the finish line. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<aside>
					If you join us at Brooklyn Alpha&hellip; you will receive hardy congrats and back pats for your motivation and hard work.
