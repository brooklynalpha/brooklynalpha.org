        <p>
            We're not happy to be making this announcement, but we've made the
            tough decision to call off Brooklyn Alpha 2012.
        </p>

        <p>
            We held out as long as we could, hoping for enough last minute registrations
            but we feel that with the small number of attendees it would not be fair to
            our attendees to continue with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's hard to say why interest has been so low, and we've been racking our brains to
            figure out where things went wrong. We don't think it's any one specific
            reason, but a combination of multiple factors. We'll continue to try to figure out
            what we can do better for the future.
        </p>

        <p>
            We hope that this doesn't deter anyone from getting started on a project or pushing
            through and releasing something great to the world. Brooklyn is a fantastic place,
            filled with many talented people, and all the more so during the second week of October.
            We hope that everyone will still come out and meet your fellow craftspeople at any of
            the numerous events that are part of <a href="https://brooklynbeta.org/beyond">Beyond Beta</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have any questions or want to discuss this any further
            feel free to send us an email at
            <a href="mailto:contact@brooklynalpha.org">contact@brooklynalpha.org</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you so much for your interest in Brooklyn Alpha, we're going
            to regroup during the coming year and hopefully be back in 2013.
