        <p>
            We're not happy to be making this announcement, but we've made the
            tough decision to cancel Brooklyn Alpha 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason we're canceling is a lack of registrations. We waited out
            as long as we could hoping that we would fill enough last minute
            spots, but as of this moment we've only had seven people register.
            We feel that with this small a number of attendees
            Alpha would not be the event that it was last year and that it would
            not be fair to our attendees or our sponsors to continue with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're not entirely sure why we had such a low number of registrations.
            There are a number of possible reasons that we've discussed and as
            normal with things like this it seems like it is "all of the above".
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or want to discuss this any further
            feel free to send us an email at
            <a href="mailto:contact@brooklynalpha.org">contact@brooklynalpha.org</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you so much for being involved with Brooklyn Alpha, we're going
            to regroup during the coming year and hopefully be back in 2013.
